    compile terminfo entries, so remove these from examples; ncurses-base
    provides a proper one already. (Closes: #351872)

rxvt-unicode (6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    + From upstream changelog: - SECURITY FIX: on systems using openpty,
      permissions were not correctly updated on the tty device and were left as
      world-readable and world-writable (likely in original rxvt, too), and were
      not restored properly. Affected are only systems where non-unix ptys were
      used (such as most BSDs, not GNU/Linux). (found, patched and debugged by
      Ryan Beasley).
    + From upstream changelog: - meta8 support was forcefully enabled in most
      configurations.  restored configurability of this (useless) feature
      (reported by Mikachu). (closes: #346150, reopen if it doesn't)
